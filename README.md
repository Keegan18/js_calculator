# js_calculator
Create a function called calculator that takes three parameters, `x`, `y`, `z` 

Create a variable called output; this is where your number returned from your function will be stored 

The first parameter determines the mathematical operation to be performed Parameters `y` and `z` are any two numbers 

Your function should have five conditionals that perform the four different mathematical operations depending on `x` (add, subtract, multiply, divide) 

Invoke your function, pass in your values, and console.log `output` 

Test your function using node.js
